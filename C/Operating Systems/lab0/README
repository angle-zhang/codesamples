ADDITIONAL FILES 
These two files are used to perform the sanity check with make check
check.sh
This is the correct output file which checks if all the options are reporting the correct errors and have to correct outputs
correct.txt

For make check, I just used the most basic cases that were asked for in the spec
input file to stdout
input file to output file
check argument handling; no argument for --input
check option handling: fake option

check segfault 
check segfault catch 
check segfault dumpcore
