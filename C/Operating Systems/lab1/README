# Lab1
Command sequences in shell scripting are often written like this: 
eg.(sort < a | cat b - | tr A-Z a-z > c) 2>> d 

The problem: 
- Syntax doesn't allow files to be opened with flags available at the system call level 
- Devs want to be able to make directed graphs of processes connected by pipes
- Simpler way to invoke shells; easier generated by programs and scripts and does not require a shell script
